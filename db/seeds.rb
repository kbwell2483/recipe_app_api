# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# 5.times do
#     Recipe.create(
#       name: Faker::Food.dish,
#       first_ingredient: Faker::Food.ingredient,
#       second_ingredient: Faker::Food.ingredient,
#       third_ingredient: Faker::Food.ingredient,
#       category: Faker::Dessert.variety
#     )
